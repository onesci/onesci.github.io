Computer Science Variables Worksheet
Chris wants you to look at the Chemistry Canvas and also this question: “We didn’t include the electrostatic interaction energy between the hydrogen cation and anion.  How can you use coulomb’s law to calculate this value?  What information do you need to do that calculation?  Can you find the info and do the calculation?  Would including this term change your answer to Q5?  Explain.”
