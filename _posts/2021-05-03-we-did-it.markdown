- ~~Physics~~ Oh god, well at least it’s done. The rest can’t be that bad.
- ~~Biology~~ I wanna die.
- ~~Mathematics~~ ha ha. ha.
- ~~Chemistry~~ Jesus Christ.

Phew! We did it—I think? This has been a frantic, distant, and impossibly difficult year, but I’m so glad we were all able to come to the end of it together. Before I stand atop my digital soapbox one last time, let me congratulate and thank you for making it to the end of Science One together with me. We did it.

Thank you to everyone in Science One for somehow having the wild skill not to necessarily do well on Chemistry tests, but to form a community without ever seeing each other beyond the veil of a computer screen. I feel like I've gotten to know you all over the course of this year, and I can’t wait to meet everyone in person.

Thank you to the Science One teaching team for making this year incredible despite a global pandemic and the scourge of Zoom lectures. Chris A., Chris W., Colin, Costanza, James, Jim, John, Nolan, Pam, and Stephen, we are so grateful and we can’t wait to meet you in person as soon as the world permits. 

Finally, thank you Zoom for making me hate you.

I hope that OneWeekly was able to serve you in some way this year and helped you. Even if it was in the smallest way, I’m grateful to have had the opportunity to help.

For the last time, thank you for visiting [OneWeekly.ca](https://oneweekly.ca). Let's blow this pop stand.
